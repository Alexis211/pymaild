PyMaild 0.1 ReadMe

-- Installation :
Just copy all these files (whith the mail/ directory) anywhere (I recommend you create a directory /opt/pymaild)

-- Configuration :
Edit pymaild.conf, change whatever you need to be changed.
You should change :
- smtprelay : put your ISP's smtp server here
- serverhostname : for a basic installation, just put in 'localhost'
- localdomain : change this to your domain name
- datapath : change this if you have not installed pymaild to /opt/pymaild

-- Starting/stopping PyMaild :
Assuming you have installed it to /opt/pymaild :
python /opt/pymaild/pymaild.py start
python /opt/pymaild/pymaild.py stop

-- Managing user mailboxes :
No mailbox is needed for PyMaild to work correctly, the default user (root, with password = root) can be deleted.
python /opt/pymaild/pymaild.py adduser [--username=<usename> --password=<password>]
python /opt/pymaild/pymaild.py rmuser --username=<user to remove>
Changing password is not supported yet

-- Updating MX record cache :
PyMaild keeps a cache of MX servers associated with each domain name (list is in mail/mxservers).
You may want to regenerate this list. To do so, first stop PyMaild, then run :
python /opt/pymaild/pymaild.py updatemx
