PyMaild 0.2 ReadMe

DISCLAIMER : PyMaild is in early alpha stage, use it at your own risk !

-- Installation :
Copy pymaild.conf to /etc. This file MUST be in /etc. If it is not, you will have to edit pymaild.py.
Copy pymaild.py to /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin if you prefer). If it is not executable, chmod +x it.
Copy the mail/ directory somewhere, for example to /var/pymaild

-- Configuration :
Edit pymaild.conf, change whatever you need to be changed.
You should change :
- smtprelay : if using PyMaild to relay mail, enter your SMTP relay server here
- serverhostname : for a basic installation, just put in 'localhost'
- localdomain : change this to your domain name
- maildir : change this if you have not copied the mail/ directory to /var/pymaild
- serverhost : change this to 0.0.0.0 to allow all IP addresses to connect

-- Starting/stopping PyMaild :
Assuming you have installed it to /usr/bin :
pymaild.py start
pymaild.py stop
All these commands must be run as a user that has write permission to maildir, pidfile and logfile (see pymaild.conf).

-- Managing user mailboxes :
No mailbox is needed for PyMaild to work correctly, the default user (root, with password = root) can be deleted.
pymaild.py adduser [<usename> [<password>]]
pymaild.py rmuser <user to remove>
pymaild.py chpasswd <username> [<new password>]
All mailboxes have some options (for example the maximum size for mailbox contents).
Modify an option : pymaild.py chopt <username> <option> <newvalue>
Modify an option in default conf (used for all new mailboxes) : pymaild.py chdefaultopt <option> <newvalue>
Show mailbox information : pymaild.py getinfo <username> (this also returns information about waiting mail count and size, and server configuration)
All these functions are to be used for example in a web administration interface. (PHP : use shell_exec() to get output of a command)

-- Updating MX record cache :
PyMaild keeps a cache of MX servers associated with each domain name (list is in mail/mxservers).
You may want to regenerate this list. To do so, first stop PyMaild, then run :
pymaild.py updatemx

-- Information about PyMaild :
[maildir]/users is the list of all mailboxes.
[maildir]/default_options is the default options for a new mailbox
[maildir]/queued-* is the contents of a queued mail, waiting for being sent.
[maildir]/[username]/mail is the list of mail files waiting in a mailbox.
[maildir]/[username]/options is the file containing options for the mailbox
